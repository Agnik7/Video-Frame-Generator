# Video Capture and Frame Extraction with Python üé•üñºÔ∏è

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the world of video capture and frame extraction! In this Python project, I have provided you with a simple and efficient way to capture video using your device's camera and extract individual frames from it. Whether you want to explore the world of image processing, create a time-lapse effect, or just have fun with your camera, this code will surely come in handy.

## 2. Aim of the Project

The Python script utilizes the power of the OpenCV library to access your device's camera, record a video stream, and then extract frames from the recorded video. OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that provides a wide range of functions for image and video processing, making it an excellent choice for this project.

The code starts by initializing the camera capture, and it then presents you with a live video feed. The recording and the image saving will happen automatically. The frames will keep on generating till the program runs.

## 3. How to Run the Code

To run the video capture and frame extraction program, follow these steps:

### 3.1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agnik7/Video-Frame-Generator.git
```

### 3.2 Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the required Python packages, including OpenCV, to execute the program successfully. You can install the dependencies using **pip** as follows:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### 3.3 Run the Program

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, open the terminal in the project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
python frame_generator.py
```

### 3.4 Accessing the Extracted Frames

After executing the program for the desired amount of time, you can find the individual frames saved as image files in this project directory only. The frames will be saved in chronological order with names like Frame1.png, Frame2.png, and so on.



That's it! You now have a collection of frames extracted from your recorded video.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your needs. Happy coding! üöÄ
